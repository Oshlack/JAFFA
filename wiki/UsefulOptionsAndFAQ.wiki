= Useful command line options =

Here are the command line options that I've found most useful when running JAFFA.

Bpipe commands:
  * _*run*_ - run the pipeline!
  * _*test*_ - print the next stage in the pipeline which will be run (without actually running it)
  * _*history*_ - tells you previous bpipe commands you've run. This makes it easy to rerun the same command again
  * _*log*_ - a log of all the info bpipe outputs to stdout. This can be useful for monitoring jobs which are running in the background.

Bpipe options:
  * _*-n_* - limits the number of samples run in parallel
  * _*-r_* - will create a html report of the running time for the pipeline.
  * _*-p_* - set a JAFFA option (see below)

JAFFA options:
  * _*readLength* - this one will need to be set every time you run JAFFA. e.g "-p -readLength=50"
  * _*readLayout* - used to specify single end reads (otherwise paired is assumed). e.g. "-p -readayour="single" '
  * see the variables at the head of `JAFFA_stages.groovy` for a full list
