#summary How to install JAFFA

= Introduction =

The JAFFA tar ball consists of some bpipe scripts (those ending in .groovy) and
a number of R scripts. Because JAFFA is a pipeline rather than a stand-alone program 
it also relies on a number of other software tools, which must be installed.

= Required software =
  * [https://code.google.com/p/bpipe/ Bpipe] - manages the pipeline. For example this will allow you to run multiple jobs in parallel etc.
  * [http://www.bioconductor.org/ R] (with the bioconductor package GenomicRanges)
  * [http://samtools.sourceforge.net/ Samtools]
  * [http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html#blat3 BLAT]
  * [http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ Fastx tools]
  * [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/ Oases and Velvet] (maybe interchanged with another assembler)
  * [http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic Trimmomatic] (may be interchanged with other trimming/cleaning tools)
  * [http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml bowtie2] (maybe interchanged with another mapper)
