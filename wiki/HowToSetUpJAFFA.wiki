#summary How to install JAFFA

JAFFA is designed to be run on the bash command-line in linux. Having an understanding
of bash (and R) would be useful to understand what the pipeline is doing, but shouldn't
be a requirement. 

= Required software =
Before installing JAFFA, there are quite a few other programs which must be install first.

  * [https://code.google.com/p/bpipe/ Bpipe] - This is a framework for managing pipeline. It's convenient because it allows multiple jobs to be run in parallel, easy restarting of jobs and a lot of other great features. JAFFA has been written using bpipe to control the pipeline stages.

  * [http://www.bioconductor.org/ R] (with the bioconductor package GenomicRanges) - Some of our filtering and data processing steps have been written as R scripts. In the future we may rewrite then to python to improve performance and remove the requirement to have R installed.

  * [http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic Trimmomatic] (may be interchanged with other trimming/cleaning tools)
