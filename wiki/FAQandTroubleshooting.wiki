* How long will it take to run and how much RAM is needed?

This will depend a lot on the depth of data (e.g. the number of bases sequenced) and on which JAFFA mode was run. The Direct mode is the least computationally expensive. Assembly and Hybrid modes can use much more memory and require longer to run because of the de novo assembly step. 

Some examples of the range to expect (based on datasets we've run on):

Direct mode on 100bp paired-end reads
  * Reads: 2.5-40 million 
  * RAM: Always 4 GB
  * Time: 1.5-25 CPU hours

Assembly mode on 50bp paired-end reads
  * Reads: 14-42 million
  * RAM: 5.5-24 Gb
  * Time: 2.5-11 hours

Hybrid mode on 100bp paired-end reads
  * Reads: 2.5-40 million 
  * RAM: 4-60 GB
  * Time: 4-100 CPU hours

* How to view the read coverage over a fusion transcript in IGV 

  # From the file, jaffa_results.csv, determine the "sample", "contig" and "contig break" of the fusion of interest. The contig must start with "Locus..", i.e. be an Oases assembled contig (and not a read ID).
  # Load IGV
  # In IGV click on "Load Genome from File" and then navigate to the directory called `<sample`>. Click on the file `<sample>`.fusions.fa
  # In the drop-down box which usually contains the chromosome names (or using the text box next to it, put in the name of `<contig>`)
  # Load the reads by clicking "Load from File". In the directory `<sample`>, select the file named `<sample`>.sorted.bam
  # To highlight the breakpoint, go to "Regions", "Regions Navigator" and put in `<contig break`> as the start and `<contig break`> +1 as the end. Then click "View".

* BLAT fails with error: _Internal error genoFind.c 2250_ *

Check the tile size limit of the version of BLAT you have installed. JAFFA assumes a tile size up to 18, but some version of BLAT (e.g. v. 35) do not support tile sizes this large. You can get around this easily by running with the option "-p contigTile=X -p readTile=X" replacing X with the maximum supported tile size. The tile size does not impact on the accuracy of results in most cases, but a larger size will make the alignment steps faster.
