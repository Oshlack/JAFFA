* How long will it take to run and how much RAM is needed?

This will depend a lot on the depth of data (e.g. the number of bases sequenced) and on which JAFFA mode was run. The Direct mode is the least computationally expensive. Assembly and Hybrid modes can use much more memory and require longer to run because of the de novo assembly step. 

Some examples from datasets we've run on:

Direct mode on 100bp paired-end reads
Reads: 2.5-40 million 
RAM: Always 4 GB
Time: 1.5-25 CPU hours

Assembly mode on 50bp paired-end reads
Reads: 14-42 milion
RAM: 5.5-24 Gb
Time: 2.5-11 hours

Hybrid mode on 100bp paired-end reads
Reads: 2.5-40 million 
RAM: 4-60 GB
Time: 4-100 CPU hours

* BLAT fails with error: _Internal error genoFind.c 2250_ *

Check the tile size limit of the version of BLAT you have installed. JAFFA assumes a tile size up to 18, but some version of BLAT (e.g. v. 35) do not support tile sizes this large. You can get around this easily by running with the option "-p contigTile=X -p readTile=X" replacing X with the maximum supported tile size. The tile size does not impact on the accuracy of results in most cases, but a larger size will make the alignment steps faster.
