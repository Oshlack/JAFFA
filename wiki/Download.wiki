[https://googledrive.com/host/0B1FwZagazjpcQU9IaURTVzd6Ym8/JAFFA_1.03.tar.gz JAFFA_1.03.tar.gz ] - Major improvements over 1.0 such as:
  * Reads that map to intronic, intergenic, and chrM regions are now first filtered out before running the pipeline. This improves the RAM and time requirements for the assembly and hybrid modes.
  * For the direct mode we now calculate spanning pairs
  * fusions classed as PotentialRegularTranscripts are no longer reported
  * we now threshold on 2 spanning reads for LowConfidence fusions (previously this was 1), to help remove library prep false positives.


[https://googledrive.com/host/0B1FwZagazjpcQU9IaURTVzd6Ym8/JAFFA_1.0.tar.gz JAFFA_1.0.tar.gz ] -This version is identical to 0.91. Improvements of 0.9 are that it works out the read length itself and includes a few bug fixes and checks. Thanks to Aliaksei Holik for correcting the bug in the spanning pairs calculation.
