This is JAFFA version 1.01

To install under linux x86_64 run:
./install_linux64.sh

Check that all paths are filled in the file tools.groovy. Note that you will need to install 
R yourself (or have it preinstalled on your system).

If bpipe installed centerally on your system you can run the pipeline like so:
bpipe run [option] < JAFFA_assembly.groovy | hybrid | direct > input files

If bpipe was installed into tools/bin you will need to run the pipeline like so:
<path to JAFFA source>/tools/bin/bpipe run [option] < JAFFA_assembly.groovy | hybrid | direct > input files
